 * "Given a binary tree, return the vertical order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from top to bottom, column by column).
 * If two nodes are in the same row and column, the order should be from left to right.
 * Examples:
 * Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
 * 3
 * / \
 * 9  20
 * /  \
 * 15   7
 * return its vertical order traversal as:
 * [
 * [9],
 * [3,15],
 * [20],
 * [7]
 * ]
