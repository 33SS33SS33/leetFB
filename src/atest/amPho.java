/*    Tell me about a time where you had to deal with conflict on the job.
If that's the case, either say how you would deal with it.
    Most interviewers would look for:
    o Getting both sides of the argument
    o Suggesting and agreeing compromise
    o Showing tactfulness
    o Showing empathy*/

     * "I find I get on with most people so it's not normally a problem. It's rather disappointing when people don't pull their weight
     * I suppose and this has happened. In that instance I spoke to the person in private,
     * explained that they were letting the team down and asked them to make more of an effort. They did."*/
