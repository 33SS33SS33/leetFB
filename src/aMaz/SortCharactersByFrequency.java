/**
 * Created by krystal on 7/3/17.
 * Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * "tree"
 * Output:
 * "eert"
 * Explanation:
 * 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
 * So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
